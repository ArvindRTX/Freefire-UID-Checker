A dynamic and visually engaging web application designed to help you quickly retrieve essential Free Fire player information. Simply input a player's Unique ID (UID) and their server region, and the app will display their in-game Nickname, Level, Region, and Signature.

Built with a strong Free Fire aesthetic in mind, this tool features a dark, futuristic design with animated backgrounds, glowing UI elements, and custom gaming-inspired fonts to provide an immersive user experience.

## üöÄ Quickstart (Using the Hosted API)

To get this frontend running quickly:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/ArvindRTX/Freefire-UID-Checker.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Freefire-UID-Checker.git)
    cd Freefire-UID-Checker
    ```
2.  **Open `index.html`:**
    Simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser. That's it!
    The frontend is configured to use a hosted Free Fire API endpoint by default.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Backend API Requirement

This frontend requires a Free Fire API backend to fetch player data. By default, it uses a publicly hosted API:

`https://freefire-api-six.vercel.app/get_player_personal_show?server={region}&uid={uid}`

If you wish to run your own backend:

1.  **Set up your Free Fire API server.**
2.  **Update the API endpoint** in the inline script in `index.html` to point to your local or self-hosted API URL:

    ```javascript
    const apiUrl = `YOUR_BACKEND_API_URL/get_player_personal_show?server=${server.toLowerCase()}&uid=${uid}`;
    ```

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

* **HTML5**: Structure of the web page.
* **CSS3**: Styling, animations, and responsive design.
* **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Dynamic content, API requests, and UI interactions.
* **Google Fonts**: `Orbitron` and `Share Tech Mono` for distinct typography.
